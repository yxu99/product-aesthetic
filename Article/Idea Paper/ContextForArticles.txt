It is known that the symmetry or asymmetry of an object [AestheticJudgmentsGraphicPatterns], 

complexity or simplicity [NoveltyComplexityHedonicValue], 

novelty or familiarity of an object [NoveltyComplexityHedonicValue], 

proportion or composition [FechnerRevisited], 

semantic content as opposed to formal qualities of design [Don't Have] and the significance of or mere exposure to a stimulus [PsychModelOfAestheticProcessing] 

all influence aesthetic experience and judgments. 

In addition, aspects of a person's emotional state [Don't have]; 

degree of interest in a stimulus [Don't have]; 

appeal to social status or financial interest [SocialHeuristicsDesignPreferences]; 

education; and historical, cultural or economic background [18] 

are known to influence aesthetic judgments. Various situational aspects also play a role; we might appreciate an object differently in a museum as opposed to in a supermarket, for example. In addition, aesthetic judgment is also determined by inter-individual differences [EvaluationOfArchitecturalColor].
